    <h2>Instructions to setup machine for Wake On LAN service</h2>
    <p>
      Basic configuration needs to be done in BIOS and in OS
      to enable Wake On LAN feature. Once enabled we can
      switch on machine from anywhere in the campus and even
      over VPN. Hence even if you are at your home hundreds
      of kms away you can switch on you lab/hostel machine,
      access it over VPN and then even power it off to use
      electricity efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Note that configuration
      in both BIOS and OS is required to make it work. If
      you omit any one of these then Wake On LAN will not
      work</span>. Instructions for machines/OS not listed
      below can be requested through email. We will try to
      add more information soon.

    <h3>Troubleshooting and simple Tips</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
	<!--<li><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Ethernet light should glow in off machine:</span>
		      <ul>
			<li>
			  We are enabling Wake On LAN in BIOS so that power is available to 
			  LAN card even when machine is off. We are enabling Wake On LAN in OS so 
			  that LAN card is configured to switch on machine when it receives Wake On LAN 
			  Magic Packet. In case Wake On LAN is not working just switch off machine as see 
			  if LEDs near Ethernet port are glowing even when machine is off. If not, 
			  it is BIOS configuration issue or machine does not supports Wake On LAN
			</li>
		      </ul>
	</li>-->
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Switch off monitor before leaving:</span>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      There is no point in leaving monitors on when you work remotely. So please 
	      switch off monitors (especially CRT) when you leave labs so that even if 
	      you work remotely monitor does not uses any power.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Shutting down machine remotely:</span>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Linux:</span> 
	      We can shutdown Linux machine remotely by connecting to root 
	      user using ssh and then running command 'shutdown -h now'. 
	      For distributions which do not allow connecting as root, we can 
	      connect as normal user and use command 'sudo shutdown -h now'.
	    </li>
	    <li><span style="text-decoration:underline">Windows:</span> 
	      Start 'Task Manager' by right-clicking on Start-Menu bar. 
	      In 'Task Manager' there is 'Shutdown' menu with option "Turn off" 
	      which can be used to shutdown machine remotely.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline">Unsupported systems:</span>
	  <ul>
	    <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Laptops :</span> 
	      I have tried three four different 
	      laptops from Dell and all of them do not support Wake On Lan. So it is good bet that 
	      laptops do not support this feature. It is still possible that HP, Acer or some other 
	      vendors laptop support Wake On Lan. 
	      <br/>
	      Laptops users who use Linux can still use Wake On LAN if instead of shutting down the 
	      system is left in suspend mode. Using GUI we get suspend option or we can also run 
	      'pm-suspend' command as root to suspend machine. Laptops wake up from suspend using 
	      WOL without any problem provided OS is configured to listen for WOL requests. 
	      <br/>
	      This has been seen to work on Dell Vostro 1400 laptops and most probably would work 
	      on other machines too. In suspend state I observed latop discharging only 3% battery 
	      power in 30 minutes. So it may take as long as 1000 minutes for laptop to run out of 
	      battery when in suspend state, as opposed to around 200 minutes when running normally. 
	    </li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight:bold">
		White HCL machines :</span> We have not been able 
	      to enable Wake On LAN on White HCL machines with code like IIIT/INST/CR06*. Even after 
	      enabling Wake On LAN in BIOS when we power off machine, even power from LAN card is 
	      cut. Hence there is no way to start machine using LAN. We are still working on finding 
	      a solution using BIOS updates.
	    </li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight:bold">Fedora 12 on Dell Optiplex 330:</span> 
	      For some reason WOL gets disabled when we shutdown Fedora 12 
	      system either using GUI menu option (System -&gt; Shutdown) or using command 
	      'shutdown -h now'.
	      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	      If we use hibernate then Wake On LAN (WOL) seems to work fine. 
	      So when using system remotely either use 'pm-hibernate' command to hibernate system 
	      or restart it using 'shutdown -r now', but do not shut it down using 'shutdown -h now' 
	      else WOL wont work. If you have already shutdown machine using shutdown 
	      command accidently then remove power cord from CPU for few seconds 
	      so that Ethernet LEDs stop blinking. Now put the power cord back in CPU and 
	      WOL will work properly.
	      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	      We will try to find better solution to Fedora 12 WOL problem soon. 
	      It works fine on Fedora 11 on Dell Optiplex. Also Fedora 12 on 
	      Black HCL machines works fine too. 
	    </li>
	    <li><span style="font-weight:bold">CentOS 5.4 on Dell Optiplex 330:</span> 
	      As with Fedora 12 on Dell Optiplex 330, if we shutdown machine then WOL 
	      does not works. Hibernate is also broken when we use CentOS-5.4 on 
	      Dell Optiplex 330. So best powersaving option is to use 'Suspend'. We 
	      can remotely suspend machine using 'pm-suspend' command and when we are 
	      leaving lab, we can use GUI to suspend machine. 
	      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	      There are few other things that also need to be taken care of when using
	      CentOS as CentOS uses relatively older libraried/kernels which have been
	      tested for years. <br/>
	      1. Use non-xen kernel as default kernel. Edit '/etc/grub.conf' and configure
	      system to boot from non-xen kernel by default. Xen does not supports ACPI
	      properly as it is meant for virtualization and guest OS do not have to woory
	      about ACPI. <br/>
	      2. Do 'lspci' and see list of PCI devices. One of the devices would be Ethernet
	      Controller. Note down the first two digits of the line where Ethernet controller
	      is listed, this is the PCI number of Ethernet Contoller. Now use 
	      'more /proc/acpi/wakeup' to see devices which are allowed to wake machine. If the
	      Ethernet PCI controller is not allowed to wake machine up then use 
	      "echo 'PCI2' &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup" to enable PCI2 to wakeup computer from suspend
	      or hibernate. (Here it was assumed the Ethernet controller PCI number is 2, replace 
	      PCI2 with PCI&lt;n&gt; for your machine, where 'n' is the PCI number of Ethernet
	      controller.
	      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	      Try to search a little on Internet if above steps are not clear to learn about
	      sleep states, hibernate etc. so that you can configure machine to Wake up when
	      in suspend or hibernate state from proper PCI device (Ethernet controller). Test
	      the setup by first suspending the machine using 'pm-suspend' and then waking it up
	      using WOL
	    </li>
	  </ul>
